## Shiny Dashboard
This research involved a complex survey dataset replete with many categorical variables and composite measures. The use of a Shiny dashboard has proven particularly invaluable, since it allowed to capture the full scope and nuances of the data. The Shiny dashboard offers a dynamic and interactive platform for data exploration, allowing for real-time adjustments and the customization of variables and parameters. This is especially beneficial for dissecting complex relationships and patterns within the data, such as interactions between various categorical variables or the internal consistency of composite measures.
